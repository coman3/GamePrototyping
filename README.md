# GamePrototyping

## What is this messy ass project?

Welp, its random C++ implementations of ideas i have had in the past / present. Its all depending on a cross platform game engine called [Urho3D](https://urho3d.github.io/) (its pretty cool i totally recommend you check it out!).

## Building
This will be a pain in the ass to build on anything but windows / linux and i can guarantee it - im a complete noob at setting up C++ projects, so hopefully i have done it right for this to work on any operating system / computer.
### Windows: 
1. Make sure you have Visual Studio 2015-2019 With `Desktop Development with C++` and `Game Development with C++` Installed
2. Install CMake Windows (Version 3.15 is what i have been using)
3. Point CMake to the project root, and build folder to `/Build`
4. Open sln project in `/Build` folder or the `Open Project` button in CMake
5. Thats it (Hopefully)
### Linux:
    > Dont ask. You should know.
### OSX:
    > Ha. You wish i was a Mac fan boy
### Android:
    > Still no idea... Yet...
### IOS:
    > Ha. Ye nah not even gonna bother with this one... Yet...
### WASM (with Windows):
    > Coming Soon....
